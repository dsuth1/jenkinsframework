This repository represents a demonstration of a potential CI/CD pipeline built around Jenkins, Ansible, Rocketchat, Azure, 
Inspec, Maven and Wildfly.  Install git, docker, and docker-compose to enable your machine,  The companion repository is located 
at http://github.com/dsutherland1492/jenkinsframeworkapp

To enable your machine, run the following as root

setenforce 0
yum install git docker epel-release
yum install python-pip
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install docker-compose
groupadd docker
usermod -aG docker $USER
systemctl enable docker
systemctl start docker

To start the application run the following commands

docker-compose up -d mongo
docker-compose up -d mongo-init-replica (only required on first run)
docker-compose up -d rocketchat
docker-compose up -d jenkins

After deployment finishes, you will need to login to rocketchat, create a user account, then login to jenkins, update the AZURE 
environment variables to match your environment and the Rocketchat plugin to match your credentials.  For automatic builds, update your 
git repository fork to publish webhooks to your Jenkins instance.
