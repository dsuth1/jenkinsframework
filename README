This repository represents a demonstration of a potential CI/CD pipeline built around Jenkins, Ansible, Rocketchat, Azure, 
Inspec, Maven and Wildfly.  Install git, docker, and docker-compose to enable your machine,  The companion repository is located 
at http://github.com/dsutherland1492/jenkinsframeworkapp

To enable your machine, run the following as root

setenforce 0
yum install git docker epel-release
yum install python-pip
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install docker-compose
groupadd docker
usermod -aG docker $USER
systemctl enable docker
systemctl start docker

To start the application run the following commands

docker-compose up -d mongo
docker-compose up -d mongo-init-replica (only required on first run)
docker-compose up -d rocketchat
docker-compose up -d vault
docker-compose up -d consul
docker-compose up -d jenkins

After deployment finishes, you will need to shell into the hashicorp vault container, initialize vault and add secrets associated with 
you Azure api keys.

docker exec -it vault.server sh
vault operator init
vault operator unseal (run this command 3x using the unseal keys printed out during initialization)
vault login (us the root token printed out during initialization)
vault write secret/admin AZURE_CLIENT=xxxxxxxxx AZURE_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx AZURE_TENANT=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
exit
 
Next, login to rocketchat, create a user account, then login to jenkins, update the Rocketchat configuration to match your credentials and 
add the vault root token credential to the vault configuration.  For automatic builds, update your git repository fork to publish webhooks 
to your Jenkins instance.
