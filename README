This repository represents a demonstration of a potential CI/CD pipeline built around Jenkins, Ansible, Rocketchat, Azure, 
Inspec, Maven and Wildfly.  The companion repository is located at http://github.com/dsutherland1492/jenkinsframeworkapp

To start the application run the following commands

docker-compose up -d mongo
docker-compose up -d mongo-init-replica (only required on first run)
docker-compose up -d rocketchat
docker-compose up -d jenkins

This requires docker and docker-compose to be installed and selinux to be disabled.  After deployment finishes, you will need 
to login to rocketchat, create a user account, then login to jenkins, update the AZURE environment variables to match your 
environment and the Rocketchat plugin to match your credentials.  For automatic builds, update your git repository fork to 
publish webhooks to your Jenkins instance.
