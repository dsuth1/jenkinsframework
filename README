This repository represents a demonstration of a potential CI/CD pipeline built around Jenkins, Ansible, Rocketchat, Azure, Inspec, Maven and Wildfly.  
The companion repository is located at http://github.com/dsutherland1492/jenkinsframeworkapp

To start the application run the following commands

docker-compose up -d mongo
docker-compose up -d mongo-init-replica (only required on first run)
docker-compose up -d rocketchat
docker-compose up -d jenkins

This requires docker and docker-compose to be installed and selinux to be disabled.  After deployment finishes, you will need 
to login to rocketchat, create a user account, then login to jenkins, update the AZURE environment variables to match your 
environment and the Rocketchat plugin to match your credentials.
